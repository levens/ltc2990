Linear Technology LTC2990
=========================

This repository contains a work in progress update of the LTC2990 Linux kernel
driver to support all possible measurement modes.

The master branch contains a fork of the driver from the kernel mainline v4.6,
which only supports current measurement mode.

If you are looking for the updated version, please checkout the latest patch-vX
branch from this repository.

The Makefile in this repository is for building the project as a module with
the Xilinx Petalinux toolchain.
